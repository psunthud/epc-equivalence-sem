# EPC Equivalence Testing in SEM

🌐 **Example Codes:**  
https://psunthud.github.io/epc-equivalence-sem/

Simulation studies, an empirical illustrative example, and presentation materials for EPC-based equivalence testing in confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM).

## Overview

This repository contains materials for the AMPC 2026 presentation and the associated manuscript on equivalence testing of Expected Parameter Changes (EPCs).

The project examines equivalence testing as a principled framework for evaluating whether model misspecifications (e.g., cross-loadings, residual correlations) are substantively trivial or substantial.

The repository currently includes:

- An empirical illustrative example (Christopher et al., 2012)
- Presentation slides

Additional simulation materials will be added later.
